    Welcome to my personal website. This is a no-nonsense portfolio showcasing my work,
    experience, and technical writing. I would love to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-jain-130527223/" target="_blank">connect</a> with fellow engineers, recruiters, or anyone interested in software.

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Yo! I'm Harsh, a engineer with eagerness to learn and solve. I am primarily focused on backend development, distributed systems, but always finding ways to scratch new technical domains.
    Currently, I spend my weekends trying to figure out what ai agent is gonna take my job lol. Seriously though, I am focusing to broaden my knowledge on how scalable systems are actually built.
