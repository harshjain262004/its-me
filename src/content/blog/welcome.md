## Welcome

This is my first blog post. I plan to write about software engineering topics, 
share technical insights, and document interesting problems I encounter.

## What to Expect

- Technical deep-dives
- Code tutorials and examples
- Lessons learned from projects
- Thoughts on software design and architecture

## Getting Started

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and uses markdown for content.
All posts are stored as markdown files in the `src/content/blog` directory.

### Code Example

Here's a simple code snippet:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

Thanks for visiting! Check back for more posts soon.
